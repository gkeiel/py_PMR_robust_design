# py\_PMR\_robust\_design

A code to compute robust proportional\_multiple\_resonant (PMR) controller and current feedback gain in order to ensure UPS stability and performance. Considering the state-space AVERAGED model, PMR controller and current gains are tuned by means of pole placement in LMI regions. Output to linear and non-linear load are plotted without the need for graphical environment circuits, which makes it simple for learning and practical applications.
